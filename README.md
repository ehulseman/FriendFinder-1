# What is FriendFinder?
A compatibility-based friend finding application. This full-stack site takes in results from user surveys, and then compares the answers to those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

# Theoretical Foundation
The questions asked in FriendFinder are based on research programs which have looked at real world friendships and surveyed real world pairs of friends and couples to determing what traits of the pairs are similar. If it was found that two friends scored similarly on a given trait, it was assumed that the similarity was probably a partial cause of the pair's formation.
